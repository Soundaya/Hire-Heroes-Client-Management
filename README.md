# Hire-Heroes-Client-Management
Hire Heroes USA empowers U.S. military members, veterans, and spouses to succeed in the civilian workforce.  Through free, signature workshops and online programs, clients are individually partnered with a highly trained Veteran Transition Specialist who works with the client to: create a tailored civilian resume that effectively highlights skills and achievements, translate military experience into civilian terminology, learn effective job searching, networking and interviewing techniques, and get connected with companies that actively hire veterans.  As a result, Hire Heroes USA confirms hired on average more than 60 clients per week.  Though this success has allowed growth in both scope and impact, there are still roughly 500,000 unemployed veterans that exist at any given time.  In order to better reach this population, Hire Heroes USA would like to analyze existing client, social media, and volunteer data to determine if there are opportunities for further improvements to their systems.

Below are the 4 proposed questions for which data analysis and modeling has been performed.

•	Is there any relationship between the amount of time spent working with individual clients (time to complete an assessment, time to complete resume, # of logged activities, etc.) and how quickly they are employed?

•	What measures should we utilize to measure process efficiency and program performance relevant at the Veteran Transition Specialist, office, and regional levels, and are there alternative measurement techniques to maximize reporting accuracy and efficiency?

•	Is it possible to correlate client and employer demographic data (candidate qualifications, geography, industry, desired career fields etc.) and our current method of matching clients with potential employers to identify new effective ways to help clients connect with companies we’ve built relationships with?

•	Does working with a volunteer raise the probability of a client getting hired or getting hired sooner? Are there certain volunteer activities that are more effective than others? Do volunteer activities increase the quality job obtained – perhaps determined through salary level? (Essentially, can we prove quantitatively that our volunteers are increasing the overall effectiveness of our program?)
